							<h4>About Me</h4>

							<p>
								I'm a graduating senior from <a href="https://csus.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento State</a>, planning to earn my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science 
								in May 2021. Enthusastic, and inquisitve, I'm a team-oriented individual looking to make my first steps in a 
								fulltime career in computing and software engineering. In this page, you can see some of my projects I've worked 
								on at school, and on my own.
							</p>
							<p>
								I specialize mainly in client-side application development, with Java, but I'm open to exploring new technologies
								and have personally experimented with using Scikit Learn, TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning, as well as
								a couple of different stacks (MEVN, Vue, MongoDB, GraphQL), for full-stack development. This page will be continuously 
								updated with more projects as I complete or work on them in my own time.
							</p>
							<p>My software interests include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
								<li>Machine Learning</li>
								<li>Computer Vision</li>
								<li>Graphics Programming</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>Other Things About Me</h4>
							<p>
								I have several other interests that extend beyond the realm of computer science as well!
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I'm a hobbyist photographer since I was in high school, and have been practicing for 9 years.</li>
								<li>I enjoy spending my free time doing community service and connecting with others.</li>
								<li>
									I've been a member of the Kiwanis Family since high school; Key Club back then, 
									Circle K International during college, in which I've held several leadership positions.
								</li>
								<li>I enjoy playing golf, and would regularly play at my local golf course, pre-COVID.</li>

							<h4>Project overview</h3>
								<p>
									<a href="https://pastachefs.github.io/trafficsim/" alt="Link to project website." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrafficSim</a> 
									is a virtual reality application built on Unreal 4.23 (C++) for the Oculus Rift, controlled using a 
									Logitech steering wheel input, developed by myself and my team. It is designed as a product to enable 
									researchers to observe and model driver behavior and interactions in a realistic setting. The application 
									presents to the user several different prebuilt maps to choose from, and also includes a built-in map editor, 
									both of which are intended to be used by our client, with little technical ability required to use the software. 
									While similar driving simulation tools already exist, this VR application comes without the same cost overhead to 
									our client as dedicated driving simulation hardware, as the costs incurred for this project would be the Oculus and 
									VR ready computer.
								</p>
								<p>
									When the player is seated into the game world, they are loaded into any of the pre-built or user made maps, 
									and every action, reaction or input made is logged into an external spreadsheet for further statistical analysis. 
									The player is able to drive around in the various conditions, time of day, and road hazards, as well as interact with 
									and avoid neighboring NPC cars.
								</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>Upcoming Features</h4>
							<p>
								The planned feature roadmap includes:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Adding more road types such as intersections and highway interchanges.
								</li>
								<li>
									Adding stop signs, traffic lights, and construction/school zone signs.
								</li>
								<li>
									Allowing the user to save a custom created map.
								</li>
								<li>
									Traffic density control, so the user/researcher can input a hard value for NPC generation.
								</li>
								<li>
									Dynamic and real time weather conditions, currently only fog density is implemented.
								</li>
								<li>
									Programmable and timeable pedestrian behavior.
								</li>
								<li>
									A scenario editor, so the user/researcher can load a specific combination of maps and map settings for more consistent observation environments.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Project overview</h4>
							<p>
								A <a alt="Github link" href="https://github.com/saechaol/learning-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learning application</a>, built using Android Studio and Visual 
								Studio which supports registration, communication, and task scheduling, that communicates directly with an AWS EC2 
								instance with a .NET application providing a REST API endpoint and an RDS backend layer. The application client itself 
								is built using Java, and it connects to an RDS instance which stores user information, class schedules, and tasks.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>
								About the API
							</h4>
							<p>
								There are several API controllers implemented in C++ in the .NET application that the client uses to fetch data relevent 
								to each screen, as well as update user, subject, and task information to the database. Each POST method is protected using an 
								implicit transactions to prevent mishandling of data should the service be interrupted mid-request. The webservice itself is 
								load balanced using AWS's built in featureset for EC2 instances, and SSL certificate to serve the endpoint over HTTPS.

							<h4>Project demo</h4>

							<h4>Project Overview</h4>
							<p>
								<a href="https://github.com/saechaol/ar-basketball-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AR Hoops</a> is an augmented reality application my team 
								and I built in 24-36 hours as a submission for the hackathon SacHacks 2021. The project is written entirely in 
								Swift, using Apple's ARKit and RealityKit frameworks. The user is able to shoot the ball towards the hoop, 
								by swiping upwards on the screen and reset its position in world space by pressing the button on the bottom. 
								We are responsible for the design and model of the basketball hoop. The ball and court is generated in-application.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>Interesting Challenges</h4>
							<p>
								My team and I took on this project despite none of us having any experience in either Augmented Reality applications,
								or an extensive Swift background. We're proud that we were able to build working prototype of the app, but we did face 
								some rather interesting challenges along the way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since none of us either had experience with Swift or augmented reality applications, a lot of time was spent studying 
								Apple's documentation for how to use ARKit/RealityKit. Luckily, Apple's documentation is rather extensive and we were 
								able to set up both the physics engine for the ball, and load in our models to the game.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, the way that the ball is moved is dependent on the player's orientation to it, and we had assumed that 
								the player would always be facing the hoop, making our swipes dependent on that direction. If you swipe left, 
								the ball would bounce towards the -X axis. <i>However,</i> we hadn't considered "What if the player moves 
								<i>behind</i> the ball? Sure enough, standing behind the ball and swiping left didn't move the ball to 
								the left, relative to our position, but <i>towards</i> the -X direction. To solve this, we implemented a 
								distance checker between the ball's position in world-space, the hoop's location in world-space, 
								and the <i>phone's</i> position in world-space. Whichever object was closer to the hoop would determine 
								which direction the ball would fly if swiped left or right. This is because logically, if the player 
								is closer to the hoop than the ball, then the player is behind the ball. Conversely, if the player is 
								further from the hoop than the ball, then the player must be in front of it.

								user signup, login, authentication, photo posting, tagging, liking and commenting, using the Vue.js framework on 
								the frontend and MongoDB Atlas on the backend. Data is fetched and mutated through GraphQL API endpoint that 
								interfaces with the database. The project is prototyped on Figma and I am expecting to complete it by late-February, 
								or early March 2021.
