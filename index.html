							<h4>Project overview</h3>
								<p>
									<a href="https://pastachefs.github.io/trafficsim/" alt="Link to project website." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrafficSim</a> 
									is a virtual reality application built on Unreal 4.23 (C++) for the Oculus Rift, controlled using a 
									Logitech steering wheel input, developed by myself and my team. It is designed as a product to enable 
									researchers to observe and model driver behavior and interactions in a realistic setting. The application 
									presents to the user several different prebuilt maps to choose from, and also includes a built-in map editor, 
									both of which are intended to be used by our client, with little technical ability required to use the software. 
									While similar driving simulation tools already exist, this VR application comes without the same cost overhead to 
									our client as dedicated driving simulation hardware, as the costs incurred for this project would be the Oculus and 
									VR ready computer.
								</p>
								<p>
									When the player is seated into the game world, they are loaded into any of the pre-built or user made maps, 
									and every action, reaction or input made is logged into an external spreadsheet for further statistical analysis. 
									The player is able to drive around in the various conditions, time of day, and road hazards, as well as interact with 
									and avoid neighboring NPC cars.
								</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>Upcoming Features</h4>
							<p>
								The planned feature roadmap includes:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Adding more road types such as intersections and highway interchanges.
								</li>
								<li>
									Adding stop signs, traffic lights, and construction/school zone signs.
								</li>
								<li>
									Allowing the user to save a custom created map.
								</li>
								<li>
									Traffic density control, so the user/researcher can input a hard value for NPC generation.
								</li>
								<li>
									Dynamic and real time weather conditions, currently only fog density is implemented.
								</li>
								<li>
									Programmable and timeable pedestrian behavior.
								</li>
								<li>
									A scenario editor, so the user/researcher can load a specific combination of maps and map settings for more consistent observation environments.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Project overview</h4>
							<p>
								<a href="https://devpost.com/software/vrcade-6fn5vt">VRcade</a> is a prize winning submission to the Virtual Reality hackathon "HackReality", on March 2021. In one week,
								our team was tasked with developing a virtual reality application with the hardware and tools of our choice. VRcade is developed
								using C# on the Unity engine, and deployed to the Oculus Quest. At the time of submission it had supported four activities, billiards,
								ping pong, tennis, and air hockey. A fifth activity, foosball, was also planned.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>
								Development
							</h4>
							<p>
								Over the course of the hackathon, I worked with my team to quickly prototype different possible ideas that we could 
								use to work on, considering our limited time frame to accomplish it. We used Unity's Oculus Integration Package and 
								Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit in order to get motion tracking and hand tracking to work. For Billiards, we also 
								provided functionality for the player to scan in a real-world table to use as support in-game. We also used Unity's
								built in version control software, Unity Collab, in order to keep track of each others changes in real time.

							<h4>Project overview</h4>
							<p>
								The <a href="https://github.com/saechaol/cifar">CIFAR-10-Based Image Classifier is</a> a computer vision, convolutional neural network model designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10
								dataset. This dataset contained ten different types of images to classify: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, 
								horse, ship, and truck. We also utilized <b>transfer learning</b> to build a secondary neural network based on the VGG16 model,
								and performed an examination of their performance.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>
								Development
							</h4>
							<p>
								Feature extraction is performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, with 10 possible outputs.
								The CNN is comprised of multiple hidden layers with a 3x3 convolution kernel with strides 1 and 2, using relu activation, 
								several 2x2 max pooling layers, dropout layers, and compiled with categorical crossentropy and the adam optimizer.
								The CIFAR-10 based model achieves a 76% accuracy rate, outperforming the transfer learning VGG16-based model, 
								which achieved a 71% accuracy rate.

								The <a href="https://github.com/saechaol/yelp-data-challenge">Yelp Rating Predictor</a> is a logistic regression model 
								trained using Yelp's academic dataset. The model is trained on the entire corpus of Yelp's provided review text, and 
								attempts to predict the score rating of a particular business based on its reviews.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>
								Model Architecture
							</h4>
							<p>
								The model consists of three fully connected layers, using tanh, sigmoid, and relu activation functions. The model is compiled
								using the adam optimizer. Feature extraction was performed over the entire body of Yelp's review text using TF-IDF vectorization. 
								Due to hardware limitations, only 1000 features were able to be vectorized and one-hot encoded. The model achieves an RMSE score of 
								0.2978, and demonstrated that the model generalized the dataset fairly well.

							<h4>Project Overview</h4>
							<p>
								<a href="https://github.com/saechaol/ar-basketball-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AR Hoops</a> is an augmented reality application my team 
								and I built in 24-36 hours as a submission for the hackathon SacHacks 2021. The project is written entirely in 
								Swift, using Apple's ARKit and RealityKit frameworks. The user is able to shoot the ball towards the hoop, 
								by swiping upwards on the screen and reset its position in world space by pressing the button on the bottom. 
								We are responsible for the design and model of the basketball hoop. The ball and court is generated in-application.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>Interesting Challenges</h4>
							<p>
								My team and I took on this project despite none of us having any experience in either Augmented Reality applications,
								or an extensive Swift background. We're proud that we were able to build working prototype of the app, but we did face 
								some rather interesting challenges along the way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since none of us either had experience with Swift or augmented reality applications, a lot of time was spent studying 
								Apple's documentation for how to use ARKit/RealityKit. Luckily, Apple's documentation is rather extensive and we were 
								able to set up both the physics engine for the ball, and load in our models to the game.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, the way that the ball is moved is dependent on the player's orientation to it, and we had assumed that 
								the player would always be facing the hoop, making our swipes dependent on that direction. If you swipe left, 
								the ball would bounce towards the -X axis. <i>However,</i> we hadn't considered "What if the player moves 
								<i>behind</i> the ball? Sure enough, standing behind the ball and swiping left didn't move the ball to 
								the left, relative to our position, but <i>towards</i> the -X direction. To solve this, we implemented a 
								distance checker between the ball's position in world-space, the hoop's location in world-space, 
								and the <i>phone's</i> position in world-space. Whichever object was closer to the hoop would determine 
								which direction the ball would fly if swiped left or right. This is because logically, if the player 
								is closer to the hoop than the ball, then the player is behind the ball. Conversely, if the player is 
								further from the hoop than the ball, then the player must be in front of it.
